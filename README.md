===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).


## Explanation of project structure:
- `index.html` is pretty much empty! 
- `js/app.js` contains the game characters and do the event handling
- `js/engine.js` have the actual game loop which sets the canvas and redraw the game each time based on the game characters data.
- `js/resources.js` is just a resource caching utility

##Game goal
Because I am late in the project I make it meet the specifications so do not expect too much from it. the gool to reach the water with out hit the enemys.
